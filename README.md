# color-combination

## Description

The "color-combination" project is a simple web application that allows users to input colors for pants and shirts and determine whether the color combination is visually appealing based on color contrast. This can be useful for individuals who want to create aesthetically pleasing outfits by considering color coordination.

## Features

- Input fields for entering color names or hexadecimal color codes for pants and shirts.
- Color contrast calculation to determine whether the combination has suitable contrast.
- Feedback message indicating whether the combination is good or needs adjustment.
- Reset button to clear input fields and reset the feedback message.
- Basic HTML and JavaScript implementation for easy understanding and customization.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Enter a color name or hexadecimal color code for both pants and shirts.
3. Click the "Check Combination" button to see whether the color combination has suitable contrast.
4. The result message will be displayed below, indicating whether the combination is good or needs adjustment.
5. To try a new combination, click the "Reset" button to clear the input fields and reset the message.

## Known Limitations

- The color contrast calculation is simplified for demonstration purposes and does not provide accurate contrast ratios.
- The color names to hexadecimal color code mapping is limited and may not cover all possible color names.
- The application does not take into account other factors affecting color coordination, such as user preferences, cultural considerations, and color theory.
